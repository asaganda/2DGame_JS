This is a 2 Dimensional game using pure vanilla JavaScript and rendered on HTML5 <canvas>

I followed a tutorial to build this game that can be found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

This tutorial which resulted in a fully functional 2 Dimensional breakout game helped me learn the basics of using the canvas element to implement fundamental game mechanics like rendering and moving images, collision detection, control mechanisms, and winning and losing states.
